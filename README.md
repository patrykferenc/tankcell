## Tankcell

Tankcell is a simple 2D co-op (or singleplayer) game about shooting up cells using tanks. Created as a part of JIMP
project (Warsaw University of Technology, Electrical Faculty, Applied Computer Science, semester II) but I decided to expand it a little bit.

### How to play

Use WSAD to move your tank and SPACE to shoot. Try to destroy more cells than the AI can! You can select PvP or PvE mode.

### Features

This section will be expanded as I improve the code. You can check out the Projects section to see what I am currently working on. 

### Assets

All assets except for buttons are original and you are free to use them for non-commercial projects. Button textures are
provided by amazing https://kenney.nl/assets.
